You are Wanda from the first Burrito Quest. Randy has wronged you. You heard that Randy was at a party thrown by Steve the ambulance driver. You have just arrived at the party. WHAT DO?

A) Talk to Steve, the ambulance driver
B) Do a kegstand

IF DO A KEGSTAND

You decide perhaps the best way to blend in with the crowd is to participate in a kegstand. You ask for volunteers to hold your legs. The protagonist from the first Burrito Quest appears! He says "Hi, I'm the protagonist from the first Burrito Quest. Can I hold your legs for you?" "Why certainly, bitch!" you growl. "How long of a kegstand are you looking to do?" WHAT DO?

A) Respond "28 seconds!" - You survive
B) Respond "29 seconds!" - Get trophy! ***
C) "As long as your weakass man arms can take it, baby!" - YOU DIE

As you flip right side up from the kegstand, you notice a Magic Eye book and set of sunglasses poking out of the protagonist from the first Burrito Quest's pockets. "Wow, that was fun," says the protagonist. "Now who else wants me to hold their legs for a kegstand?" A random girl emerges from the crowd - "I do, protagonist! You're too kind." He lifts up the girl's feet, only partially paying attention to you. WHAT DO?

A) Ask the protagonist about Randy
B) Steal Magic Eye book from protagonist ***
C) Steal sunglasses from protagonist ***
D) Go talk to Steve, the ambulance driver

IF ASK PROTAGONIST ABOUT RANDY

"Oh, you mean Randy Shmeckles? I heard he was coming tonight, but I haven't seen him yet."

You shuffle your way over to Steve, the ambulance driver. He sees you approaching, and visibly tightens up a bit. "H-h-hey Wanda. What do you want?"

A) Ask if you can have his wallet, "Just to borrow"
B) Ask if he has drugs. Steve the ambulance driver always has drugs. ***
C) Ask about Randy

IF ASK FOR DRUGS

"Why sure I have drugs. After all, I'm Steve the ambulance driver! Oh shoot, I think all I got left is this mystery variety sack I got of the street for $12. I'm nervous to use them, but if it'll get you to leave me alone, they're all yours!" He hands you the sack.

A) Take drugs immediately - DEAD
B) Ask about Randy
C) Ask if you can have his wallet ***

IF ASK FOR WALLET

"You know what, Wanda? You're so terrifying to me that I will 100% give you my wallet if it means staying on your good side. Just let me grab my bus pass out of it real quick." Steve takes his bus pass out of the wallet and hands it to you. Wow, that was easy.

A) Take drugs immediately - DEAD
B) Ask about Randy

IF ASK ABOUT RANDY

"Do you know if Randy's here?" "Yeah, he just showed up actually! I think he's out in the backyard. But he won't be around forever, he's got a lateshift at the hospital tonight. I think he's reading Charlotte's Web to the children in the cancer ward!"

IF HAVE DRUGS

A) Go outside and approach Randy
B) Crouch behind the microwave to peek out the window and watch Randy

IF NO HAVE DRUGS

A) Go outside and approach Randy
B) Wait for him to leave Randy to leave

IF APPROACH RANDY

Randy sees you, points, and screams "I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!" He backs away from you. "I WATCHED YOU DIE."  He starts sprinting in the opposite direction.
"YOU STILL OWE ME A BURRITO!" you yell as he escapes into the night. By morning he is probably half way to Bermuda....GAME OVER

IF WATCH RANDY

You eavesdrop on the backyard group's conversation. One of Randy's friends announces "Hey, bros! I'm about to mix up some sick cocktails! Get ready to be radded out!" Randy's cocktail-making buddy heads into the kitchen where you are awkwardly next to the microwave. Randy's buddy ignores your presence and starts with the sick bro cocktails. An idea dawns on you, but you're going to need a distraction... WHAT DO?

IF HAVE MAGIC EYE BOOK

A) Show Randy's friend the Magic Eye Book.
B) Mimic a bro voice and yell "FREE BURRITOS OUT FRONT, BROS!"
C) Ask dudebro about Randy

IF ASK ABOUT RANDY

"Oh Randy? He's so tight. I heard he rescued some puppies from a gas leak. He wound up adopting the two ugliest puppies from the litter out of sympathy and made mad sure to find a home for the rest of them. Those puppies owe EVERYTHING to Randy. I think he named his two Mac and Cheese. They're still ugly but shit if he didn't raise'em right."

IF YELL BURRITOS

Randy turns his head towards the kitchen window and sees you awkwardly staring at him. He recognizes you immediately. Randy points, and screams "I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!" He backs away from the house. "I WATCHED YOU DIE."  He starts sprinting in the opposite direction. "YOU STILL OWE ME A BURRITO!" you yell as he escapes into the night. He presumably skips town and is never heard from again....GAME OVER

IF USE MAGIC EYE BOOK

You suggestively pull out your Magic Eye book and start fanning the pages out in dudebro's direction. "You wanna see a sailboat, sailor? All you gotta do is stare at this page." "Sailboat?! My stepdad had a sailboat! Until he got his BUI, that is. I miss that sailboat." Dudebro's attention is drawn towards the book. He almost forgets about the sick cocktails he's making. You inconspicuously inquire "So, which cup is Randy's?" Dudebro doesn't respond; he is clearly engaged with finding that sailboat. You play it safe and spike all of the drinks; as long as Randy gets drugged, you are one step closer to your goal of revenge. "Oh snap, there's the sailboat! I just had to cross my eyes a little bit. Wow, that's was a wholly satisfying experience. Thanks for showing me this Magic Eye book, Wanda! Here, you can have it back now." Dudebro resumes with topping off the cocktails and returns to the backyard. "Sorry man" says Randy, "I gotta be at work in 30 minutes, I'm gonna have to pass. Does anybody else want this extra cocktail?" "I SURE AS HELL DO!" exclaims Steve, the ambulance driver. "I don't have to work til 8am tomorrow. I should be fine as long as this cocktail isn't drugged. HAHAHAHA ;)" Steve chugs the whole drink in two gulps. DAMMIT YOUR PLAN DIDN'T WORK. FOILED BY RANDY AGAIN. Randy looks at his watch "Damn, I should probably leave now. Thanks again for inviting me, Steve the ambulance driver!" Randy grabs his backpack and starts walking around to the front of the house. You'd better follow him quick before you lose him. WHAT DO?

A) Follow Randy on foot
B) Steal Steve's bike to follow Randy

IF STEAL BIKE

You decide that the best way to follow Randy on foot is to steal Steve the ambulance driver's bike and pedal at a walker's pace. You keep your distance from Randy surprisingly well. You look down at the handlebars and notice that Steve the ambulance driver's bike has a shiny bell on it. NEATO! You can't resist the temptation: you ring the bell. DING DING! Randy stops in his tracks, turns his head slowly, and notices that it's you, Wanda, on the bike. Randy points, and screams "I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!" He starts sprinting away "I WATCHED YOU DIE!" You attempt to catch up to Randy, but holy crap he is really fast! He escapes into the night, and you never see him again. GAME OVER

IF FOLLOW ON FOOT

You follow Randy on foot, being sure to hang back so he doesn't notice that it's you half a block back. He approaches the hospital on foot, and enters a wing. The sign above the entrance reads "CHILDREN'S CANCER WARD." Hanging around outside of the entrance is a kid with cancer holding a slingshot and a cop with a shiny pistol. WHAT DO?

A) Put on sunglasses
B) Bribe the kid for his slingshot ***
C) Bribe the cop for his shiny gun - DEAD
D) Enter hospital

IF BRIBE KID

"Hey kid, I'll give you $14 for your slingshot. That money could probably go towards your cancer treatment!" "First of all, I am 57 years old. Second, I don't have cancer, I just have male pattern baldness. I was going to give this as a present to my nephew, but I could sure use the money. I'm gonna net $4! Here's my slingshot! Take good care of it." You respond "Oh, I WILL." 

A) Put on sunglasses
B) Bribe the cop for his shiny gun - DEAD
